<h1>Bingus Clicker FAQ</h1>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>What was the inspiration for Bingus Clicker?</dt>
		<dd>The game was strongly inspired by "Snow Clicker".</dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>How do I get started?</dt>
		<dd>If you want people, you'll need to have enough food to support 
		them, and they will need to have a place to live. Make sure you 
		have enough food and at least a tent or wooden hut to start with.</dd>
		<dt>I made a worker, but they died straight away!</dt>
		<dd>Workers eat food. Do you have enough spare?</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>Features</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>How do I get more cats?</dt>
		<dd>It is a mystery.</dd>
		<dt>How do I get more deities?</dt>
		<dd>You'll need to reset your game; you get one deity per 
		playthrough (collect them all!).</dd>
		<dt>But if I reset, don't I lose everything?</dt>
		<dd>You get to keep your achievements (you <em>need</em> to reset
		to get them all), your old deities and some of their upgrades 
		(the Pantheon Upgrades section lists the permanent ones), your 
		wonders, and your cats.</dd>
		<dt>How do I get gold?</dt>
		<dd>You need to trade for it with the traders who show up randomly.</dd>
		<dt>Can I buy bonuses for old deities?</dt>
		<dd>You can only buy upgrades for your current deity. You'll be 
		able to do more stuff with old deities in the future.</dd>
		<dt>My people hate me! How can I fix this?</dt>
		<dd>For the moment, happiness is boosted by victorious raids, or 
		if you have Aesthetics, by building lots of temples.</dd>
		<dt>I don't seem to be making any progress on my wonder. 
		Am I doing it right?</dt>
		<dd>You need a lot of labourers and a lot of every kind of resource. 
		Really a lot.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>The Past</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Is the game complete?</dt>
		<dd>Descendo Solutions, the original author,</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>The Present</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>So who is working on Bingus Clicker?</dt>
		<dd>I'm Descendo Solutions, I made Bingus Clicker.</dd>
        <dd>Also, I intend that this version always remain clean of any sort
        of tracking code, such as Google Analytics.  I know it's fun for a
        dev to be able to watch as people use your code, but we have little
        enough privacy left already, so I want to preserve what we've got.
        Finally, I don't want to bring in any external libraries or frameworks
        at this time; I'd like to see how far the game can go using pure vanilla 
        JS.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>The Future</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>So...what's the plan from here?</dt>
		<dd>First, I'm going to take some time (okay, quite a lot of time) 
        to learn the code, and refactor it to be more extensible.  This will
        allow bigger and better things in time.  However, it means that there
        will probably only be minor bugfixes for a while.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>BUGS</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>I have a bug.</dt>
		<dd>First, try seeing if a force refresh (Ctrl-F5) fixes things. This sorts 99% of problems.</dd>
		<dt>Okay, I still have a bug.</dt>
		<dd>Sorry about that! Please file a ticket on the project page.  Screenshots are helpful, as is an exported save string.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>Other questions</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Why do you need so many farmers?</dt>
		<dd>In pre-industrial society, farmers operated at barely above subsistence level, so the numbers aren't actually too far off real life. With lots of upgrades and mills, the efficiency of farmers improves significantly.</dd>
		<dt>What browsers does Bingus Clicker support?</dt>
		<dd>I'm using "Chrome", so it gets the most testing.  My intent is that
		Bingus Clicker should work on any version of the major browsers that's less
		than a year old.</dd>
		<dt>Can I help?</dt>
		<dd>If you like the game, I'd appreciate if you shared a link so more people can see it. :)</dd>
		<dt>I meant, do you need any help coding?</dt>
		<dd>Not at the moment; I'm gradually refactoring the code, and
		having more people on it would probably slow the process down with
		coordination overhead.  Once I finish the refactoring phase, however,
		I'm likely to want better graphics, sound, and translations, though,
		so if your skills lie in those areas, please let me know!</dd>
